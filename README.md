## Local Setup

```bash
composer install
npm install
copy .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Update `.env` with your own local database credentials:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=campus_found
DB_USERNAME=your_local_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_password
```

Then run:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

Open the website at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Admin Access

This project does not store a real administrator account or password in source code.

For the current local admin-key flow, set a unique value in your local `.env`:

```env
LOSTFOUND_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-your-own-local-password
```

Admin URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login
```

Do not commit `.env`, real admin passwords, database passwords, API keys, exported database files, or local SQLite databases.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
npm run build
```

Optional quality checks:

```bash
composer audit --locked
vendor/bin/pint --test
```

Current verified result:

```text
25 tests, 173 assertions
```

## Postman

Import:

```text
postman/LostFound_API.postman_collection.json
```

Before running requests, fill the collection variables locally:

- `base_url`
- `email`
- `password`
- `owner_token`
- `claimant_token`

The collection does not include real login credentials.

## Security Notes

- `.env` is ignored and must stay local.
- Generated files, local databases, SQL dumps, storage uploads, and keys are ignored.
- The seeded data is sample-only and does not create an administrator account.
- Use unique passwords for local, staging, and production databases.
- Rotate any credentials that were previously committed or shared.
- If credentials were pushed in Git history, rewrite or recreate the repository history before public sharing.

## Production Checklist

- Set `APP_ENV=production`.
- Set `APP_DEBUG=false`.
- Set the public HTTPS `APP_URL`.
- Generate a new production `APP_KEY`.
- Use a dedicated production database user and password.
- Configure mail credentials through environment variables only.
- Run `php artisan migrate --force`.
- Run `php artisan storage:link`.
- Run `php artisan optimize`.
- Configure queue workers if email notifications are enabled.
- Configure persistent storage or object storage for uploaded images.
- Enable HTTPS and rotate any exposed credentials before deployment.
